# Culinary Chronicles

## Description

**Culinary Chronicles** is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete recipe cards. This project was built to demonstrate how local storage can be used to save and manage data on the client side without the need for a back-end server. Users can add new recipes, edit existing ones, or remove them, and the data persists across page reloads using the browser's `localStorage`.

- **Edit Recipes**: Recipes can be edited by clicking on the "Edit" button.
- **Delete Recipes**: Users can remove any recipe by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Persist Data**: The application stores recipe data in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, ensuring the data remains even after a page refresh.
- **Search Recipes**: A search functionality allows users to filter recipes by their titles.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a mobile-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling the recipe cards and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity, local storage handling, and DOM manipulation.
- **LocalStorage API**: For saving and retrieving recipes in the browser.
